# Cloud Studio

This is a Windows application for visually managing AWS resources. It (attempts) to visually show AWS resources such as VPCs, subnets, ELBs, and instances on a Windows form. The goal for Cloud Studio is to be able to visually lay out and create your AWS resources.

Cloud Studio has not been developed for some time so it may be out of date with the newer AWS APIs. If you find Cloud Studio and its goals useful and would like to help update it please submit pull requests!
