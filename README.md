# Cloud Studio

This is a Windows application for visually managing AWS resources. It (attempts) to visually show AWS resources such as VPCs, subnets, ELBs, and instances on a Windows form.

This application has not been developed for some time so it may be out of date. If you find it useful and would like to help update it please submit pull requests!
